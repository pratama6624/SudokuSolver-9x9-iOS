# Sudoku Generation and Solving Techniques

Sudoku is a number puzzle game that challenges players to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. Generating and solving Sudoku puzzles requires a variety of techniques and algorithms. Below is a comprehensive list of some known techniques, ranging from beginner methods to advanced algorithmic approaches.
